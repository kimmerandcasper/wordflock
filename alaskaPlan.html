        Even though Brewster is a shorter route, the hour addition going to Seattle seems worth it for a couple of reasons. 1, it much more frequently carries populated destinations which lowers the likelihood of running into bears, raises the likelihood of finding help, gathering gas funds, and finding people to pray with. For a round trip, I need around $200 for gas and will need to stay at 10 places (about $1000 if each place is $100 a night; let's call it $1500 to be safe with an extra stop in Hyder). I'll likely need to stay at one place for 2 nights to gather all the gas money I'd need. That said, I could cut that down by trying to gather those funds in Richland, Washington; however, I do feel like gathering the funds in a place outside of my origin is more adventurous. In addition, with the right gear to keep me warm, a handlebar heater, and my heated jacket setup, maybe I could travel further?

        I know I can travel roughly 1 hour and 30 minutes on 1 tank. From my research, it looks like there should be gas every 45 minutes even in northern Canada near Hyder. However, before each location, I should do research to double-check hours and operation status.

    <div class="section">
        Canadian money is required. They don't take American cash. And gas is much more expensive there, so I may have to beg in Hyder for additional funds. I also would like to stay an extra day in Hyder to regain my strength and beg if I need to. Plans that could cut down on costs significantly: Warmer gear to travel further and cut a day off the trip. Staying with a friend in Seattle saving 1 day of lodging (may or may not be possible). Obtaining sponsors (this is required).
