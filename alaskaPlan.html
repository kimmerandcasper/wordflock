        <div class="section">
            Richland to Seattle. Seattle to Boston Bar, BC. Boston Bar to Kersley, Kersley to Fraser Lake, Fraser Lake to Kitwanga, Kitwanga to Hyder Alaska. Now I know this is 6 stops, but I want to factor in mistakes.

        <div class="section-heading">Gas</div>
        <div class="section">
            I know I can travel roughly 1 hour and 30 minutes on 1 tank. This means that I need gas destinations roughly every 1 hour and 30 minutes out, which Canada may not provide. In that event, I'll need a gas canister to haul for a section of the trip.
        </div>
        <div class="section-heading">Gas Route</div>
        <div class="section">
            From my research, it looks like there should be gas every 45 minutes even in northern Canada near Hyder. However, before each location, I should do research to double-check hours and operation status.
        </div>
        <div class="section-heading">Money / Currency</div>
        <div class="section">
            Canadian money is required. They don't take American cash. And gas is much more expensive there, so I may have to do begging in Hyder for more additional funds. I also would like to stay an extra day in Hyder to regain my stregnth and beg if I need to.
