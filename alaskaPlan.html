            Even though Brewster is a shorter route, the hour addition going to Seattle seems worth it for a couple reasons. 1, it is a much carries much more populated destinations which lowers the likelihood of running into bears, raises the likelihood for finding help, gather gas funds, and finding people to pray with. For a round trip I need around $200 of gas and will need to stay at 10 places (about $1000 if each place is $100 a night: let's call it $1500 to be safe with an extra stop in Hyder). I'll likely need to stay at one place for 2 nights to gather all the gas money I'd need. That said, I could cut that down by trying to gather those funds in Richland Washington, however, I do feel like gathering the funds in a place outside of my origin is more adventurous. In addition, with the right gear to keep me warm, and handle bar heater, and my heated jacket set up, maybe I could travel further?

            Richland to Seattle. Seattle to Boston Bar, BC. Boston Bar to Kersley, Kersley to Fraser Lake, Fraser Lake to Kitwanga, Kitwanga to Hyder Alaska. Now I know this is 6 stops, but I want to factor in mistakes.

            I know I can travel roughly 1 hour and 30 minutes on 1 tank. This means that I need gas destinations roughly every 1 hour and 30 minutes out, which Canada may not provide. In that event, I'll need a gas canister to haul for a section of the trip.

            From my research, it looks like there should be gas every 45 minutes even in northern Canada near Hyder. However, before each location, I should do research to double-check hours and operation status.

        <div class="section">
            Canadian money is required. They don't take American cash. And gas is much more expensive there, so I may have to do begging in Hyder for more additional funds. I also would like to stay an extra day in Hyder to regain my stregnth and beg if I need to. Plans that could cut down on cost significantly: Warmer gear to travel furter and cut a day off the trip. Staying with a friend in Seattle saving 1 day of lodging (may or may not be possible). Obtaining sponsors (this is required).
